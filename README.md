### **Objective:**

Develop a simple web application that allows users to create and share a 10-panel comic strip. The comic is generated by inputting text into a form, which is then sent to a text-to-image API using a provided API key.

### **Key Requirements:**

1. **User Interface:**
    - Design a user-friendly UI with a form for inputting text for 10 comic panels.
    - Include a display area for the generated comic panels.
    - Ensure the application is responsive and functional on both desktop and mobile browsers.
2. **API Integration:**
    - Use the provided API key to integrate with the text-to-image API.
    - Handle API responses appropriately and display the images in their respective panels.
3. **Error Handling and Rate Limiting:**
    - Implement user feedback mechanisms for failed API calls or internal errors.

### **Bonus Features (Optional):**

- Ability to add speech bubbles or text annotations on the images.

### **Deliverables:**

- A deployed web app on a URL is best. If thats not possible then submit a github URL with code.

### **Techstack:**

- HTML, CSS, JS, Google Fonts, html2canvas, jspdf
